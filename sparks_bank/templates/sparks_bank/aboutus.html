    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <h3>
      Sparks was formed in 1955 at the initiative of the World Bank, the
      Government of India and representatives of Indian industry. The principal
      objective was to create a development financial institution for providing
      medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses. Until
      the late 1980s, Sparks primarily focused its activities on project
      finance, providing long-term funds to a variety of industrial projects.
      With the liberalization of the financial sector in India in the 1990s,
      Sparks transformed its business from a development financial institution
      offering only project finance to a diversified financial services provider
      that, along with its subsidiaries and other group companies, offered a
      wide variety of products and services. As India’s economy became more
      market-oriented and integrated with the world economy, Sparks capitalized
      on the new opportunities to provide a wider range of financial products
      and services to a broader spectrum of clients. Sparks Bank was
      incorporated in 1994 as a part of the Sparks group. In 1999, Sparks became
      the first Indian company and the first bank or financial institution from
      non-Japan Asia to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
